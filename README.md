# Snake

To run, simply open index.html in a web browser

# TODO Items:

- Allow the snake's starting direction to be set to a different value from up.
	Doing this now results in a snake that is not centered correctly
- Think a bit more about color scheme, very monochrome right now
- Include some backup fonts in case a browser doesn't have the defaults
- Consider using a circular buffer for queue implementation.  Still need to
	repopulate when snake eats a candy, but better performance to slow there
	rather than at a random time
